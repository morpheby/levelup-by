Our ideal candidates are hands on developers who understand how to build scalable, service based systems, preferably in Python and have a proven track record of bringing their ideas to market.  We are looking for engineers with all levels of experience, but you must be a proven leader and outstanding developer to work at edX.</p>

          <p>There are a number of projects for which we are recruiting engineers:<br>

          <p><strong>Learning Management System</strong>: We are developing an Open Source Standard that allows for the creation of instructional plug-ins and assessments in our platform.  You must have a deep interest in semantics of learning, and able to build services at scale.</p>

          <p><strong>Forums</strong>:  We are building our own Forums software because we believe that education requires a forums platform capable of supporting learning communities.  We are analytics driven.   The ideal Forums candidates are focused on metrics and key performance indicators, understand how to build on top of a service based architecture and are wedded to quick iterations and user feedback.

          <p><strong>Analytics</strong>:  We are looking for a platform engineer who has deep MongoDB or no SQL database experience.  Our data infrastructure needs to scale to multiple terabytes.  Researchers from Harvard, MIT, Berkeley and edX Universities will use our analytics platform to research and examine the fundamentals of learning.  The analytics engineer will be responsible for both building out an analytics platform and a pub-sub and real-time pipeline processing architecture.  Together they will allow researchers, students and Professors access to never before seen analytics. 

          <p><strong>Course Development Authoring Tools</strong>:  We are committed to making it easy for Professors to develop and publish their courses online.  So we are building the tools that allow them to readily convert their vision to an online course ready for thousands of students. </p>

          <h3><strong>LEARNING SCIENCES ENGINEER</strong></h3>
          <p>In 2012, edX reinvented education. In 2013, the edX learning sciences team is charged with reinventing education, again. The goal of the team is to prototype and develop technologies which will radically change the way students learn and instructors teach. We will engage in projects in learning analytics, crowdsourced content development, intelligent tutoring, as well as radical changes to the ways course content is structured. We are looking to opportunistically build a small (3 person), fast-moving team capable of rapidly bringing advanced development projects to prototype and to market. All members of the team must be spectacular software engineers capable of working in or adapting to dynamic, duck typed, functional languages (Python and JavaScript). In addition, we are looking for some combination of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deep expertise in mathematics, and in particular, advanced linear algebra, machine learning, big data, psychometrics, and probability. </li>
            <li>UX design. Capable of envisioning user interface for software that does things that have never been done before, and bringing them through to market. Skills should be broad and range the full gamut: graphic design, UX, HTML5, basic JavaScript, and CSS. </li>
            <li>Interest and experience in both research and practice of education, cognitive science, and related fields. </li>
            <li>Core backend experience (Python, Django, MongoDB, SQL)</li>

          </ul>
          <p>More than anything, we’re looking for spectacular people capable of very rapidly building things which have never been built before. We’re capable of providing both traditional employment, and potentially, in partnership with MIT, more academic opportunities.</p>
