      <imageresponse>
        <imageinput src="/static/images/firecode.jpg" width="640" height="480" rectangle="(365,42)-(423,66)" />
      </imageresponse>
      <solution>
          <div class="detailed-solution">
              <p>Explanation</p>
              <p>The fire code requires that all exits be clearly marked, so the red exit sign is the correct answer.</p>
