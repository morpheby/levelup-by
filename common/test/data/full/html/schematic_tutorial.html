<tr><td>T</td><td>\(10^{12}\)</td> <td></td> <td>u</td><td>\(10^{-6}\)</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td>\(10^{9}\)</td> <td></td> <td>n</td><td>\(10^{-9}\)</td></tr>
<tr><td>M</td><td>\(10^{6}\)</td> <td></td> <td>p</td><td>\(10^{-12}\)</td></tr>

<td>Add a wire</td>
<td>Wires start at connection points, the open circles that
appear at the terminals of components or the ends of wires.
Click on a connection point to start a wire &mdash; a green wire
