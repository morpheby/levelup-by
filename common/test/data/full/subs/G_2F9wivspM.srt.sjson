    "looks like this.", 
    "And let&#39;s go ahead and measure\nsome voltages and currents.", 
    "In terms of terminology,\nremember", 
    "this is called a loop.", 
    "So if I start from the point\nC, and I travel through the", 
    "voltage source, come to the node\nA, down through R1 and", 
    "all the way down through R2\nback to C, that&#39;s a loop.", 
    "Similarly, this point A is a\nnode where the register R1,", 
    "the voltage source V0 and\nR4 are connected.", 
    "Just make sure your terminology\nis correct.", 
    "So what I&#39;ll do is let me make\nsome quick measurements for", 
    "you, and show you that these KVL\nand KCL are indeed true.", 
    "So the circuit&#39;s up there.", 
    "So let me take some\nmeasurements.", 
    "And why don&#39;t you write down\nwhat I measure on the board.",

    "So I get three volts for the\nvoltage from C to A. So why", 
    "don&#39;t you write down\nthree volts.", 
    null, 
    "OK, so the next one\nis minus 1.6.", 
    null, 
    "And so that will be\nI&#39;m doing AB, VAB.",

    "And then let me do\nthe last one.", 
    "And it is minus 1.37.", 
    "Within the bonds of experimental\nerror, notice", 
    "that if I add up these\nthree voltages, they", 
    "nicely sum up to zero.", 
    "OK, next let me focus\non this node here.", 
    "And at this node, let\nme go ahead and", 
    "measure some currents.", 
    null, 
    "What I&#39;ll do now is change to an\nAC voltage so that I can go", 
    "ahead and measure the current\nwithout breaking my circuit.",

    "I&#39;m taking as well.", 
    "What I have here is three wires\nthat I have pulled out", 
    "from D. And this is the node D.\nSo three wires coming into", 
    "the node D just to make it a\nlittle bit easier for me to", 
    "measure stuff.", 
    "So everybody keep your fingers\ncrossed so I don&#39;t", 
    "look like a fool here.", 
    "Hope this works out.", 
    "So it&#39;s about 10 millivolts\npeak to peak out there.", 
    "Let&#39;s say that if the wave form\nrises on the left hand", 
    "side, it&#39;s positive.",

    "And this time it&#39;s a negative,\nroughly 20, I", 
    "guess, negative 20.", 
    "So I&#39;m getting, in terms of\ncurrents, I have a positive", 
    "10, a positive 10 and a negative\n20 that adds up to 0.", 
    "But more interestingly, I can\nshow you the same thing by", 
    "holding this current\nmeasuring probe", 
    "directly across that node.", 
    "And notice that the net current\nthat is entering into", 
    "this node here is zero.", 
    "So that should just show you\nthat KCL does indeed hold in", 
    "practice, and it is not just a\nfigment of our imaginations.",
